# FriendlyScore Finance Manager iOS SDK

## Overview

### Introduction

Here you can find instructions on how to integrate and use FriendlyScore Finance Manager for iOS.

To get started quickly with FriendlyScore Finance Manager for iOS, clone the GitHub repository and run the example. You will need to [sign-up](https://friendlyscore.com/getting-started) for the free API keys through our Developer Console.

### Requirements

- Xcode 10 or greater
- iOS 12.0 or greater
- [FriendlyScore API keys](https://friendlyscore.com/company/keys)

## Quickstart Demo App

Clone and run the demo project from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FriendlyScore/FriendlyScore-Finance-Manager-iOS-Example/).

## Installation

FriendlyScore Finance Manager is a framework distributed using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) dependency manager. If you are not familiar with this concept, please follow [detailed instructions here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

To integrate, add `FriendlyScoreFinanceManager` to your `Podfile`

```bash
pod 'FriendlyScoreFinanceManager'
```

then run following command in your project main directory:
```bash
pod install
```
CocoaPods will install and embed all sources and dependencies into your app.

## Implementation
When `FriendlyScoreFinanceManager` is available in customer panel, the SDK will populate a grid of banks to enable connecting and data sharing.

### UI

Start by importing `FriendlyScoreCore` and `FriendlyScoreFinanceManager`:

```swift
import FriendlyScoreCore
import FriendlyScoreFinanceManager
```

Create the `ClientId` object
```swift
let myClientId = ClientId(stringLiteral: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID")
```
Create the `Credentials` object using `userReference`, which is any alphanumeric string that identifies the user in your systems. It can be used later to access information from the FriendlyScore [API](https://friendlyscore.com/developers) :
```swift
let myCredentials = Credentials(clientId: myClientId, userReference: "YOUR_USER_REFERENCE", environment: .sandbox)
```
Now, using the `myCredentials` object, you can present the `insights` or `forecast` SDK anywhere in you code. Usually this can be done after the user's demand, e.g.Â tapping a button:

```swift
//somewhere in view controller
let insightsButton = UIButton(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 130, height: 45))
insightsButton.setTitle("Launch FriendyScore Insights!", for: .normal)
insightsButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(insightsButtonTapHandler), for: .touchUpInside)

self.view.addSubview(insightsButton)


let forecastButton = UIButton(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 65, width: 130, height: 45))
forecastButton.setTitle("Launch FriendyScore Forecast!", for: .normal)
forecastButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(forecastButtonTapHandler), for: .touchUpInside)

self.view.addSubview(forecastButton)

/**
...
..
*/

@objc func insightsButtonTapHandler(button:UIButton) {
    FriendlyScore.showInsights(with: myCredentials)
}
@objc func forecastButtonTapHandler(button:UIButton) {
    FriendlyScore.showForecast(with: myCredentials)
}
```
`FriendlyScore` will be presented as a modal view at the automatically found top-most view. 


### Theme
`FriendlyScoreFinanceManager` can be presented with  `light` (deafult) or `dark` theme, wiich are predefined list of colors and icons.

```swift
    FriendlyScore.showInsights(with: myCredentials, theme:.dark)
```
There is also possibility to create custom theme by setting list of key-value json file. Please follow our tutorial to [learn more](https://github.com/FriendlyScore/FriendlyScore-FinanceManager-iOS-Example/blob/master/pfm_colors.md) .

#### Custom category color and icon for Insights
Apart of UI colors you can also replace default categories icons and colors. Use example below:

```swift
    FriendlyScore.change(color: UIColor.red, icon: UIImage(named: "my_icon")!, for: .otherExpenditure)
   
   // then present UI
    FriendlyScore.showInsights(with: myCredentials, theme:.dark)
```
Here is complete list of categories:

```swift
public enum Category:String {
    case bankTransaction = "Bank Transactions"
    case bills = "Bills"

```swift
FriendlyScore.eventsHandler = { event in
    switch event {
    case .userClosedView:
        print("SDK view closed by user.")
    case .userCompletedFlow:
        print("Friendy Score user completed flow.")
    }
}
```

```swift
FriendlyScore.errorHandler = { error in
    switch error {
    case .userReferenceAuth:
        print("There was an authentication error for the supplied `userReference`")
    case .server: //unabled to get config
        print("There was a critical error on the server. SDK view closed automatically")
    case .serviceDenied: //wrong client id, access endpoint unpaid
        print("The service you are trying to connect is denied. Reason: \(error.description). SDK view closed automatically")
    }
}
```
